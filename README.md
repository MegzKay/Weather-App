#Weather App
This is a Weather App I created using ReactJS. How the app works, is that it takes your inital 
location and gets the weather using openweathermap. If for some reason navigator.geolocation is
not working properly or you have blocked it, it will use a preset location. In order to find the 
weather in another location, all you need to do is simply drag the marker

##To Use
 1) Download or clone and use npm install 
 2) Go into app/components/App.js and replace KEY_HERE with openweathermap api key 
 3) Go into app/index.html and replace KEY_HERE with Google Maps Api Key
